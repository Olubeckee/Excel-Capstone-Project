- Advise the management of KMS on what to to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers
- KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?
- Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?
- If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowestshipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer
- Which small business customer had the highest sales?
- Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 – 2012? How many orders were placed by the Corporate customer?

## The Approach
I followed this approach in modelling the solution above for the business challenge:

Business Understanding

Data Preparation

Data Exploration & Analysis

Data Visualization

Business Recommendation

## Business Understanding
The Goal of the case Study is carry out a Business Intelligence Analysis into the Company Order Data. A grasp understanding of the problem to be solved drive the whole analysis to be done.

## Data Preparation
A Microsoft Excel Worksheet (xlsv) dataset which contains the Orders from 2009 to 2012 was provided for analysis consisting of 8400 rows and 18 columns. Other information provided include Customer Name, Returned Item and Users
An overview of the dataset is shown below;

# DATA PREPARATION
It is often said that generally Data Scientists/Data Analysst tend to spend 70% of the project time on data preprocessing , exploring the data and various treatment.

- Data Preparation
In preparing the data the first step taken was to Prepare the Excel workbook, ensuring the Excel file was shapened as seen in the figures displayed above, what this means is I converted the data set into a Table so as to make it easier to work with and also to create Pivot Tables and Chart. I Renamed the table as *sales*

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

*If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything*

~ Ronald Coase

After cleaning the data and preparing it, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was then performed on the data to gather insights that will be useful to help the Management  make Informed decision About the Business Problem
